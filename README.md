# compas_libigl

Opinionated COMPAS compatible bindings for top-level algorithms of libigl.

## Requirements

* Anaconda(3)
* COMPAS

Anaconda 3 can be obtained from the official website. With `conda` installing COMPAS is as simple as `$ conda install COMPAS`. Make sure you have the latest version of COMPAS. You can check the version by typing `python -c â€œimport compas; print(compas.__version__)` in terminal.

## Git Submodules

* libigl
* PyBind11

## Compile

Before using cmake to compile the file, make sure followings are correct

* cmake version >= 3.12
* confirm your anaconda python location by typing `which python` in terminal
* change the `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` as well as `PYBIND11_PYTHON_VERSION` in `compas_libigl/CMakeLists.txt` if it does not match your system settings.

In terminal

* `mkdir build`
* `cd build`
* `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
* `make -j 4`

## Usage

To find the compiled library, please go to `compas_libigl/lib`. Taking `igl::triangulation` as an example, to run it just type `python lib/triangualtion/triangulation.py` in terminal. The program should run correctly without throwing error.

## Notes

### Goals

* Create bindings that can be used in Blender (CPython) and in Rhino (IronPython).
* Provide solutions based on cmake, pybind, Rhino SDK.

### Challenges

* Callbacks
* Live updating
* Dynamic visualisation

**Blender**

Bindings have to be generated for specific versions of Python, corresponding to
the embedded Python of different Blender releases. For example, Blender 2.78 expects
Python version 3.5.2.

**Rhino**

Bindings have to be generated using the Rhino SDK such that .NET compatible code
can be exposed through RhinoCommon.
