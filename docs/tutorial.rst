* Similar input parameters as hte original code
* Meshes represented by a list of vertices and a list of triangles
* Both Python lists and Numpy arrays are supported
* Most functions are implemented as pluggables for plugins of COMPAS core
* Therefore, the code can be used from compas_libigl or from compas directly
* Results can easily be visualized using the COMPAS Viewer
* Since the binding is generated with PyBind11 and wraps C++ code, it cannot be used in Rhino/Grasshopper directly
* However it can be used there through RPC
